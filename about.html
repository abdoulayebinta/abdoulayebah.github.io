        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h3>I want to build things that make a difference.</h3>
        <p> After my study in France. I began with programming to create websites for my personal projects 
            but after a while people started to contact me to develop their websites. </p>

        <p>I worked with technologies such as ReactJS, Electron, JavaScript, NodeJS, Python, Java and many other languages.
                
        <p>I built a lots of applications for very small companies and organizations like eHealth Africa and many others.</p> 
                
        <p>But besides developing, I like to interact with people by teaching what I love. </p>
                
        <p>
            I've always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful to me.
            Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns (which I never regret) - from junior software
            developer, to a data analyst, to a software developer, to a business analyst 
            and finally to a product manager and an entrepreneur.
            I've never stopped engaging my passion to help others and solve problems. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As a fullstack web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail, 
            my unequivocal love for making things, and my passion-driven work ethic to
            literally change the world. That's why I'm excited to make a big impact at 
            a high growth company.
